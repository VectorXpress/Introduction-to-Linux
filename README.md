# What is the command line interface?
The [command line interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) (CLI) provides direct access to a computer, allowing you to request hardware actions that [graphical user interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) (GUIs) can't handle.

While command lines are available on many operating systems, both proprietary and open source, they are often associated with Linux. This is because command lines, combined with open source software, offer users unrestricted control over their computer.
